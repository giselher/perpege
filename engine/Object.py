Provides Objects classes wich inherits form Sprite classes.

Object (inherit from pygame.sprite.Sprite)
    - attributes
        + crect (for collision detection)
    - methods
        + drawRects (draws the rect and crect)
        + setPosition (sets the position of the rect and crect)
        + setCollisionRect (change or set the crect)
        
ImmobileObject (inherit from Object)
    
MovableObject (inherit form Object)
    - methods
        + move (moves the rect and the crect)
        
AnimatedObject (inherit form MovableObject)
    - methods
        + setAnimations (sets the animations)
        + loop (animation loop)
